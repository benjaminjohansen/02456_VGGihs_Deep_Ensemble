### Run the notebook
Open the jupyter notebook A_vggish_Ensemble-Lite. Make sure you are running Python 3.0 and Tensorflow 1.2.
Data download links are in the script.

The following script will run a lite version of a VGGish Ensemble method to be used on the [TUT Acoustic Scene data set](cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2017/challenge/task-acoustic-scene-classification-results#). 

The first parts of the script will import the data, split as specified at the competion. For this version, a subset of preprossed data has been added. To run the fool data, use the logmel converter script, and place the files accordingly.

The VGGish Deep Ensemble consist of:
